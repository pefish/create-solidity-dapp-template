# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
ENV=local PKEY=** npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
npx hardhat flatten contracts/token/PBC.sol > flatten/token.sol
```
